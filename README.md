This repository is to start my SF journey and gracefully update all the day to day things which I handle and projects I accomplished.

1. Successfully implemented Agentforce SDR and generated prompt templates

3. Participated in the release cycle and identified various bugs and created known issues which came part of the SF release.
4. Will be highlighting all the known issues I have created as part of Spring 25.
